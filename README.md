# RF Hunter: Antenna Array detecting WiFi/Bluetooth

## Overview

RF Hunter is a hobby project that implements a direction-finding system for 2.4 GHz WiFi and Bluetooth signals using an array of directional antennas and ESP32 microcontrollers. It utilizes antenna array to estimate the direction from which the signal is comming. Itâ€™s designed as a hobby project with coarse directional accuracy, it provides an exciting platform to experiment with RF detection.
