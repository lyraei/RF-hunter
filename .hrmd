## Working Principle

RF Hunter uses an array of eight 2.4 GHz directional antennas, each connected to its own ESP32 microcontroller.  Each ESP32 scans for WiFi or Bluetooth signals and measures the Received Signal Strength (RSSI).  By comparing the RSSI values across all eight antennas, the system determines which antennas are receiving the strongest signal, and thus, the approximate direction of the signal source.  The antenna array uses a 2x4 rectangular configuration.

*   **8 x 2.4 GHz Directional Antennas (PCB Patch Antennas recommended):** Should be linearly polarized and designed for the 2.4 GHz band.  PCB patch antennas offer a good balance of size, cost, and performance.  Pre-made antennas or DIY PCB antennas can be used.
*   **Antenna Array PCB:** A custom-designed PCB holds the eight antennas and ESP32 modules, providing power distribution and connections. Antenna spacing should be around 6.5cm (approximately λ/2 at 2.4 GHz).
*   **5V Power Supply:** Provides power to all ESP32 modules.
*   **Connectors (Optional but Recommended):** SMA or u.FL connectors for easy antenna connection/replacement.
*   **Visualization (Optional):** LEDs (arranged in sectors), a small LCD/OLED display, or a serial connection to a computer to display the estimated direction.

## Hardware Components

## Software/Firmware

The ESP32 firmware is responsible for:

1.  **Scanning:**  Scanning for nearby WiFi or Bluetooth signals (you may choose to filter for specific SSIDs or device addresses, or just look for the strongest signal).
2.  **RSSI Measurement:**  Reading the RSSI value for each detected signal.
3.  **Averaging:**  Averaging RSSI values over a short time window (e.g., 5 seconds) to smooth out fluctuations.
4.  **Direction Estimation (two approaches):**
    *   **Decentralized (Simple):** Each ESP32 determines the direction locally based on its own RSSI readings compared to its antenna's position in the array.  The simplest implementation might just have each ESP32 controlling an LED to indicate "strongest signal."
## Software

    *   WiFi/Bluetooth scanning using ESP32 libraries.
    *   RSSI reading for detected signals.
    *   Data transmission (either directly to a display, or to a central processing unit for analysis).
*   **Direction Estimation Algorithm:** (Example code in `/processing` directory - incomplete).  Implemented in a central unit or distributed among ESP32s, this algorithm compares RSSI values and assigns a direction sector.

    *   50-ohm controlled impedance traces

## Software

The software is written for the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.  It consists of two main parts:

1.  **Master ESP32 Code:**
    *   Controls the RF switches.
    *   Receives data of I/Q values from slave ESP32's.
    *   Calculates the phase difference from I/Q data.
    *   Estimates the Angle of Arrival (AoA).
    *   Sends the calculated AoA and other data (e.g., via Serial, Wi-Fi).
    * Implements a calibration routine.

2.  **Slave ESP32 Code:**
        *  Connect to 2 downconverter outputs
        * Sample the data from ADCs.
        * Transfer the data to Master ESP32

## Signal Processing

The core signal processing technique employed is **phase interferometry**.  Here's a simplified explanation:

1.  **Downconversion:** The 2.4 GHz RF signal from each antenna is downconverted to a lower intermediate frequency (IF) using the HMC788 and mixers. The output of each mixer channel is the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the signal.

2.  **Sampling:** The I and Q components are sampled by the ESP32's ADCs.

3.  **Phase Difference Calculation:** For each pair of antennas, the phase difference between the received signals is calculated using `atan2(Q, I)`.  This gives a phase angle in radians.

4.  **Angle of Arrival (AoA) Estimation:**  The phase differences from multiple antenna pairs are used to estimate the AoA.  The relationship is based on the geometry of the antenna array and the wavelength of the signal:

    ```
    AoA = arcsin( (phase_difference * wavelength) / (2 * pi * antenna_spacing) )
    ```
    Where the *phase_difference* is between two antennas, *wavelength* is of the signal(aproximately 12.5cm for Wifi), and antenna_spacing is the distance between the same two antennas.

5.  **Calibration:** Due to manufacturing tolerances and component variations, calibration is essential.  This involves measuring the phase differences for known signal source locations and creating a lookup table or applying a correction factor.

## PCB Design

The PCB design is crucial for the proper functioning of the RF circuitry.  Key considerations include:

*   **Impedance Control:**  All RF traces must be designed as 50-ohm transmission lines (microstrip or stripline). A PCB stack-up calculator should be used.
*   **Ground Plane:** A continuous, unbroken ground plane is essential for signal integrity and minimizing interference.
*   **Component Placement:**  Keep RF components close together. Separate analog and digital sections.
*   **Shielding:**  Consider RF shielding around sensitive areas.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  **Hardware Setup:** Gather all the hardware components listed above.

3.  **Software Setup:** Install the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO and the necessary ESP32 libraries.

4.  **Breadboard Prototyping (Recommended):** Before committing to a PCB, build a simplified version with *two antennas* on a breadboard to test the core functionality.

5.  **PCB Assembly:** Once the PCB is fabricated, assemble the components, paying close attention to soldering quality, especially for RF components.

6.  **Software Upload:**  Upload the Master and Slaves ESP32 code to the respective microcontrollers.

7.  **Calibration:** Perform the calibration procedure described in the software.

8.  **Testing:** Test the system with known RF sources (e.g., a Wi-Fi router, a Bluetooth device).

## Limitations

*   **Accuracy:** The accuracy of this system is limited by several factors, including component tolerances, noise, multipath interference, and the simplified algorithms used.  It's not a precision measurement device.
*   **Multipath:** Reflections of signals off objects can significantly affect the accuracy of the AoA estimation.
*   **Interference:**  The 2.4 GHz band is crowded, and interference from other devices can affect performance.
*   **Range:** The detection range depends on the signal strength of the source and the gain of the antennas.
*  **Single Frequency**: The system has to be specifically tuned for a LO and RF frequency. The difference can not exceed the IF frequency.

## Future Improvements

*   **Improved Algorithms:** Implement more sophisticated algorithms (e.g., MUSIC, Capon Beamformer) to improve accuracy and handle multipath.
*   **RSSI Integration:** Incorporate Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) measurements for better source discrimination.
*   **Multiple Source Detection:** Develop algorithms to detect and locate multiple simultaneous signal sources.
